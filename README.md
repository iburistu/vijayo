# vijayo (vih-JAY-oh)

vijayo is an open source video editor written in Electron and powered by FFmpeg ported to WebAssembly.

vijayo is **not**:

-   Windows Movie Maker circa Windows XP
-   Sony Vegas Pro
-   Shotcut

vijayo aims to be simple and easy to use. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Testing vijayo:

`yarn` is preferred.

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

I haven't added an Electron build tool yet. I'll update this document when it can _actually_ be built.

## Roadmap:

I'd like to get vijayo to MVP status eventually.

Pressing additions:

[ ] File I/O
[ ] Loading in \*.mp4 files
[ ] Timeline view
[ ] Exporting
